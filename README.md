overview of the project and the functionality of the machine learning
modules: training, compiling, installing and observing.

## Running the project

Use Docker to build and run the whole project.

1.  Clone this repository
2.  Run

``` bash
docker compose up -d
```

This will set up both the backend and frontend, and a network between
the two

If the bridge is also needed on the same machine, use the
[docker-compose-with-bridge.yml](./docker-compose-with-bridge.yml) file.
This will build and run the frontend, backend and bridge and create a
network between all three components.

1.  Clone this repository
2.  Run

``` bash
docker compose -f docker-compose-with-bridge.yml up -d
```

Note that requires the [Sysbox runtime](https://github.com/nestybox/sysbox) to be installed and running, as the bridge uses this module.

### Running individual parts of the project

See instructions in respective repositories for frontend, backend and
the birdge / relay service for MCUs.
